                    <p id="motto">Putting the “Tech” in Technical Compliance</p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="biotext">Non-compliance can ruin budgets, but burdensome compliance can cripple innovation. Businesses benefit when auditors are sufficiently technical as it strengthens the organization’s overall compliance posture and allows application teams to focus on delivering business value.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="biotext"><b>Employ Technical Resources - </b>Tech auditors need to be technical. Auditors and application teams dedicate hours clarifying technical details which could be avoided if both parties spoke the same language. Auditors do not need to know the intricacies of writing code but knowing how to dive into a code repository, work a command line interface, write basic SQL queries, understand networking basics, and other key technical skills empowers them to efficiently perform audits. Auditors with technical expertise benefit from independently self-validating compliance as it removes the reliance on application teams and boosts the audit’s validity by having a truly independent third party. Application teams benefit from audits run by technical resources since they are able to start collaborating on issues rather than clarifying details.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="biotext"><b>Single Source of Truth -  </b>The increasing number of regulatory laws creates organizational demand for specialized internal audit teams that develop processes and controls to ensure compliance. Ultimately, this results in application teams having to answer countless requests from multiple audit teams on multiple systems. This repetition detracts from teams' ability to deliver the innovative value required by the business. <br><br> Organizations simplify the lives of both application and audit teams when they centralize to a single source of truth for all audit information. A centralized source of truth drastically reduces the effort that application teams spend learning new systems and duplicating efforts over multiple questionnaires. In turn, this standardization also empowers audit teams by reducing the need for training materials, increasing availability of audit data, promoting collaboration across audit teams, and providing external auditors with a unified view.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="biotext"><b>Audit the System of Record - </b>Many technical audits consist of application teams compiling hundreds of screenshots that are either emailed or uploaded into repositories. These types of processes are time-consuming as application teams attempt to interpret the controls and identify the required evidence. The reliance on interpretation increases the probability of shortcomings with the evidence resulting in rework or failed controls. Furthermore, screenshots are easy to manipulate while systems of record are not.<br><br> Internal audit teams who ensure that systems of records meet compliance standards are able to independently self-serve the required audit information and develop mechanisms to detect when applications fail to meet compliance. Not only does this save teams time harvesting screenshots but it also empowers auditors to self-serve and independently validate compliance.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="biotext"><b>Develop Automated Controls - </b>Manual processes will never provide 100% compliance. Instead, organizations can implement automated controls that ensure that teams operate in a compliant manner. The rise of DevOps and feature-rich code repositories have created limitless opportunities for automated controls. Organizations are able to develop or purchase integrated data-driven solutions that prevent non-compliant code from ever reaching a production environment. These solutions could consist of DevOps pipeline that terminates a build if a compliance check fails or a GitHub plug-in that blocks non-compliant code. Internal audit teams can work with infrastructure teams to implement automated controls that proactively ensure 100% compliance via operational guardrails.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="biotext"><b>Deploy Technical Compliance Tiger Teams - </b>Application teams do not specialize in compliance controls but in developing features that deliver actionable business value. Teams can spend considerable time interpreting compliance requests, researching remediation options, and implementing configurations that potentially meet compliance requests.This detracts from the innovation that helps maintain the organization’s competitive advantage.<br><br> Investing in technical tiger teams whose sole purpose is to ensure standardized compliance across an organization would improve the auditor experience while reducing the time spent by teams on compliance. These tiger teams would have the expertise to efficiently validate an application’s compliance posture and collaborate with teams to quickly remediate instances of non-compliance. The standardization introduced by these teams throughout the organization would facilitate long-term sustainability and provide a uniform auditor experience.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="biotext">Ultimately, the cost of non-compliance is not an option; however, the untold impact on productivity due to inefficient compliance poses similar risks to businesses. Leaders need to invest in sustainable and efficient compliance especially as technology becomes an integral part of a business’s competitive advantage.</p>
