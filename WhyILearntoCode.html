                    <p id="motto">Why I learned to code: Four Reasons Why Product Managers Should Know the Basics</p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="biotext">It is 10:30pm at Fort Lauderdale's airport. I'm cramped next to an outlet desperately typing in code before my flight departs. Boarding call begins. Time is up. I wake up early the next morning and find the issue within minutes. I had typed a "c" instead of "C" for one of the variables. How could I be so stupid? I had learned two valuable lessons that day. One, always use console.log() EVERYWHERE. Two, coding stressed and panicked only leads to garbage code. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="biotext">So why would I put myself in this situation as a product management professional? Shouldn't I be focusing on prettifying some slides?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="biotext">Well, I did not intend on becoming a developer when I signed up for the six month full-stack developer boot camp. My decision forced me to juggle an already packed work week with weekly lectures and countless infuriating hours debugging code that should work (at least in theory). Despite the added white hairs, learning to code has started returning dividends as I gain core technical competencies and lessons learned that enable me to better manage tech teams and excel at product management. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="biotext"><b>Sympathize with your Team</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="biotext">Managing a team of developers without any programming experience is similar to coaching a soccer team with only having watched it on TV. You would understand the desired outcome but fail to connect with your players at a personal level. This would probably result in the players initially distrusting the coach due to an inherent human reaction to question leaders incapable of sympathizing. Coding is no different. Developers trust and appreciate leaders who know that coding isn't easy. It's imperative to demonstrate a sense for the intricacies of the developer experience and be able to laugh at a terrible coding meme. Understanding the coding experience allows product managers to jump-start their relationship with a technical team.  </p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="biotext"><b>Set Realistic Expectations</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="biotext">Avoid being the product manager who tells a developer to “just add a button” due to a lack of technical expertise. Product managers have the responsibility of understanding the existing product infrastructure so that they are able to set realistic expectations with their teams, clients, and leadership. Basic technical proficiency allows product managers to quickly grasp the feasibility of a desired feature and effectively communicate limitations to a demanding stakeholder. It also allows the product manager to approach complex product decisions with both business and technical lenses. The results are improved features that incrementally add value while minimizing technical debt and, most importantly, stress on the development team.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="biotext"><b>Improve the Developer Experience</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="biotext">Improving the Developer Experience (DX) has become a movement to be reckoned with. Gone are the days when developers had to adhere to outdated, burdensome business processes (*cough change advisory boards cough*). Companies must face a new reality: snacks, soft drinks, and beanbag chairs won’t retain top-talent. Developers feel empowered by the cutting-edge applications that they pour their time and craftsmanship into. Product managers have the crucial responsibility of removing unnecessary obstacles that inhibit their team from delivering groundbreaking features due to their role within the crux of the technical and functional.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="biotext"><b>Bridge the Gap</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="biotext">IT departments are a thing of the past. Companies no longer have the luxury of treating IT as an afterthought and must integrate tech into their business strategy and operations or risk falling behind more innovative competitors. Product managers find themselves in the opportune position to enable the fusion of two worlds often perceived as bipolar. Technical knowledge allows product managers to translate complex technical concepts in a manner that resonates with leaderships empowering them to make well-informed strategic decisions. Conversely, technical versatility allows product managers to distill business jargon and elaborate slide decks so that tech teams understand how a seemingly insignificant feature may ultimately return tremendous business value in the long run.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="biotext">Today’s most iconic CEOs (i.e. Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos) are a living testament to the powerful dynamism of leaders with both technical and functional proficiency. I invite all product managers to join me in exploring the nexus between the technical and functional in a journey to unlock an even greater potential.
